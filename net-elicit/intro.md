## Eliciting the future

Eliciting from experts the potential future distributions is not easy. It typically involves a series of questions without much visual guidance to how the answers provide translate into the implied future distributions. 

Interactive apps, such as the one below, can provide a more visual approach to elicitation. Built using shiny, the parameters from split normal distributions (using `qsplitnorm` in fanplot) can be converted into a fan chart (using `fan` in fanplot)

The underlying parameters of a split normal distribution can potentially be used to incorporate expert opinions in a Bayesian modelling framework.
